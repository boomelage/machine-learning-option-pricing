## 2.1 Pricing Model

To model the logarithmic price of our underlying security, we use the Heston (1993) model, described by the pair of stochastic differential equations:

$$
dX_t = \left( r - \frac{v_t}{2} \right) dt + \sqrt{v_t} \left( \rho dW_t + \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} dB_t \right) \quad (1)
$$

$$
\hspace{1.9cm}  dv_t = \kappa (\theta - v_t) dt + \eta \sqrt{v_t} dW_t \hspace{1.8cm} \quad (1.1)
$$


where
- $v_0$ represents the initial variance,
- $\theta$ is the long-run variance,
- $\rho$ is the correlation between the log-price process and its volatility,
- $\kappa$ is the mean reversion of the variance to **ùúÉ**,
- $\eta$ is the volatility of the variance process, and 
- $B_t$ , $W_t$ are continuous random walks.

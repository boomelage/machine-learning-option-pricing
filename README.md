# 1. Introduction

In this paper we will explore a proposed method of pricing exotic options via neural-network-based approximations derived from the simulation of a multidimensional space representing an option's price as a functional form of its features. To achieve this, we calibrate historical Heston (1993) parameters using market observed risk-free and dividend rates accompanied by live options trade data, allowing for stochastic volatility. This paper serves as a framework and demonstration of a generalized estimation process for barrier and Asian options along with a model specification and retraining analysis. We will explore the estimation of barrier options priced via finite difference as well as Asian options priced via Monte Carlo.

# 2. Pricing Model

To model the logarithmic price of our underlying security, we use the Heston (1993) model, described by the pair of stochastic differential equations:

$$
dX_t = \left( r - \frac{v_t}{2} \right) dt + \sqrt{v_t} \left( \rho dW_t + \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} dB_t \right) \quad (1)
$$

$$
\hspace{1.9cm}  dv_t = \kappa (\theta - v_t) dt + \eta \sqrt{v_t} dW_t \hspace{1.8cm} \quad (1.1)
$$


where
- $v_0$ represents the initial variance,
- $\theta$ is the long-run variance,
- $\rho$ is the correlation between the log-price process and its volatility,
- $\kappa$ is the mean reversion of the variance to **ùúÉ**,
- $\eta$ is the volatility of the variance process, and 
- $B_t$ , $W_t$ are continuous random walks. 

The implementation of stochastic volatility of the underlying log price is imperative to the functionality of our model as we are aiming to estimate the prices of path-dependent options which may even require discrete monitoring of the spot price.

# 3. Price Estimation

In the spirit of Liu et. al. (2019) and Frey et. al. (2022) we will generate a development dataset by simulating possible parameter combinations for a given security. Liu et. al. (2019) demonstrate a considerable increase in computational efficiency with retention of low errors for the estimation of implied volatilites via neural networks by considering the relative spot price (i.e., the spot price scaled the strike price $S/K$) and the relative option price (i.e., the option's price divided by its strike $C/K$) of the option as opposed to their levels ($C$ and $S$), a method we will be borrowing for our estimation. Frey et. al. (2022) propose a data generation method via Cartesian product to create a sample space of vanilla option pricing features to estimate the price level ($S$). Testing of this method considering exotic options did not retain the same level of pricing accuracy as evidenced by high partial dependence of the target price in relation to the underlying spot price level $S$ and $v_0$. We therefore propose a new method combining the Carterisan product approach to retain control over feature combinations while conisdering the option's relative price ($C/K$) as well as any other linear features also scaled by the strike price $K$.

## 3.1 Barrier Options

In the case if barrier options, we begin generating the development dataset by iterating through the historical spot prices and volatility parameters and for each trading day, performing the Cartesian product:
<br>

$S \times K \times T \times B \times R = \set{ (s, k, t, b, r_{\text{rebate}}) | \ s \in S, \ k \in K, \ t \in T, \ b \in B, \ \text{and} \ r_{\text{rebate}} \in R\}$

<br>

where
- $S$ is a single element set consisting of the underying spot price, <br>
- $K$ is a set of strikes spread around the spot, <br>
- $T$ is a set of maturities, <br>
- $B$ is a set of barrier levels, and <br>
- $R$ is a set of rebates which for the purposes of this study in a set consisting of only the element $0$ (zero)
<br>
and duplicating the data for calls/puts, down/in, and up/down option types which can also be achieved by their inclusion in the Cartesian product using software like itertools.


## 3.2 Asian Options
For the Asian option counterpart, we perform a similar iteration of our historical data, for each day performing the Cartesian product:
<br>

$S \times K \times T \times A \times P = \set{ (s,k,t,a,p) | \ s \in S, \ k \in K, \ t \in T, \ a \in A, \text{and} \ p \in P \}$
where
- $S$ is a single element set consisting of the underying spot price, <br>
- $K$ is a set of strikes spread around the spot, <br>
- $T$ is a set of maturities, <br>
- $A$ is a set of time frequencies at which the Asian option fixes
- $P$ is a set of past fixings which for the purposes of this study is a set consisting of only the element $0$ (zero)
<br>
and duplicating the data for calls/puts and arithmetic/geometric averaging which can similarly be achieved by their inclusion in the Cartesian product using software like itertools.

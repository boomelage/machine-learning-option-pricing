# 1. Introduction

The main scope of this paper is to devise a data generation method that can be reliably used to train machine learning algorithms in pricing options under stochastic volatility models. It has been demonstrated by Frey et al. (2022) that Single Layer and Deep Neural networks are able to accurately predict vanilla option prices given a large synthetic training dataset. 

The data generation method outlined below is an extension of Frey et al. (2022) with additional considerations regarding feasibility of all feature combinations. The machine learning model specification is nearly identical to that of Frey et al. (2022) with minor exceptions including the use of relative absolute pricing error as a performance metric, as well as exploration of additional activation functions and solvers.

Following this result, it was considered whether ScikitLearn Neural Network models could be used to price exotic options such as barrier and Asian options. Thus, we aim to generalize a data generation routine for generic at-the-money (ATM) volatilites which will allow us to train the model on a carefully curated dataset representing user defined market conditions.


# 2. Model Specification

## Pricing model

To model the logarithmic price of the underlying security, we use the Heston (1993) model, defined by pair of stochastic differential equations:

```math
dX_t = \left( r - \frac{v_t}{2} \right) dt + \sqrt{v_t} \left( \rho dW_t + \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} dB_t \right),
```

```math
dv_t = \kappa (\theta - v_t) dt + \eta \sqrt{v_t} dW_t
```
where
- **ùë£‚ÇÄ** represents the initial variance,
- **ùúÉ** is the long-run variance,
- **ùúå** is the correlation between the asset price and its volatility,
- **ùúÖ** is the mean reversion of the variance to **ùúÉ**, and
- **ùúÇ** is the volatility of the variance process.
  
The model becomes suitable for fitting to our proposed method via approximation of implied volatilities as proposed by Derman (2008):
```math
\sigma(K, t_0) = \sigma_{\text{atm}}(S_0, t_0) - b(t_0)(K - S_0)
```
